# 2017-Cholera-in-Yemen

[Back to the portfolio page...](https://marialma.github.io/)

Pulling data from the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/yemen-cholera-outbreak-daily-epidemiology-update) in an effort to learn a bit more about the cholera outbreak in Yemen. I am also using a dataset from the [Yemen Data Project](http://yemendataproject.org). I'm using this as a chance to learn and exercise some skills. 

The current plan is to shape data using R, then using Bokeh in Python to display it. 

## To Do:
* Plot out outbreak data using [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/).
* Map data with time series 
* Include bombing data
