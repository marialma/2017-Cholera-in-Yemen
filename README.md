# 2017-Cholera-in-Yemen

[Back to the portfolio page...](https://marialma.github.io/)

Pulling data from the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/yemen-cholera-outbreak-daily-epidemiology-update) in an effort to learn a bit more about the cholera outbreak in Yemen. I am also using a dataset from the [Yemen Data Project](http://yemendataproject.org). I'm using this as a chance to learn and exercise some skills. 

The current plan is to shape data using R, then using [Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) in Python to display it. This choice is out of a desire to make this more of a learning experience. 

## To Do:
- [x] Plot out outbreak for governorates 
  * [Check this out here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/marialma/2017-Cholera-in-Yemen/blob/master/2017Cholera.html)
- [ ] Map data with time series 
- [ ] Include bombing data 

## 
[Initial mapping attempt in Tableau here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/maria.ma5849#!/vizhome/YemenCholera/Story1), but I feel like there are too many limitations to using Tableau. I hope to start to recreate this. (D3.js?)
