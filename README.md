# 2017-Cholera-in-Yemen

[Back to the portfolio page...](https://marialma.github.io/)

Pulling data from the Humanitarian Data Exchange in an effort to learn a bit more about the cholera outbreak in Yemen. I'm using this as a chance to learn some R. I'll be shaping the data in R, and displaying using Tableau Public. The final visualization will be displayed here when I'm done. 

2017/09/08 - Have decided that Tableau is probably not the right choice for this. Will learn Python to use Bokeh instead.
