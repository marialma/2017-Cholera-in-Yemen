# 2017-Cholera-in-Yemen

# Pulling data from the Humanitarian Data Exchange in an effort to learn a bit more about the cholera outbreak in Yemen.

# I'm using this as a chance to learn some R. I'll be shaping the data in R, and displaying using Tableau public. 

# Also, I wanna finally learn how to use Github :D
